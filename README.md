Salary prediction over a certain threshold

In this second project as part of TMLC's (The Machine Learning Company) mega guided projects course, we take a look at a data set pertaining to salaries. The objective is to predict whether or not a person (given some features) will make a higher or lower
salary given a certain threshold.
